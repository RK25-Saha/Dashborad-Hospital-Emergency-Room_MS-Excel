I recently dived deep into the world of interactive dashboards using Excel, Power Query, and more, and I’m thrilled to share my latest creation—a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard! 📊🏥

With the guidance of Satish Dhawale’s insightful classes, I’ve learned how to transform raw data into meaningful, visually engaging reports that help with data-driven decision-making.

✨ Key Insights from My Dashboard:
✅ Patient statistics & admission trends 📈
✅ Average wait time & satisfaction scores ⏳😊
✅ Attendance efficiency & gender analysis ⚖️
✅ Age-wise patient distribution & referral trends 📊

Creating this dashboard has been an amazing learning experience, reinforcing the power of data visualization in healthcare and beyond. If you’re passionate about data analytics or looking to build interactive reports, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
